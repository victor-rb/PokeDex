# PokeDex
PokeDex For AnDroid

Just Another Pokedex App For android.

I made this apllcation using retrofit with Gson to learn the framework.

The App consume the data from PokeAPI JSON files : https://pokeapi.co/ 

The App consist in get the data from the JSON Files and populating the fields 
through the models and integration data classes (DOA and DTO PAckages).

First Iniitializing on the #1 Pokemon ,BulbaSaur , and have field to search with the number of the pokemons.

The App is only funcional at the moment (and must be the 4th version that I created), for the future, I will
implement a better decoration and a list of pokemons group by generation and other Ideas that might come in 
my mind (or suggestion, of course).

This Project (and the others on GIT) is a learning workplace, It might be not the best way or implementation
of the resources, but it`s my way of developing my skills in kotlyn (I used JAVA prior to that) and frameorks 
of the moment, I am open to Suggestion and feedback.

Someday the App will be on Play Store, I just dont have the re$ources to do it now, but the APK is on the following 
share.
