PokeDex For AnDroid

Just Another Pokedex App For android.

I made this apllcation using retrofit with Gson to learn the framework.

The App consume the data from PokeAPI JSON files : https://pokeapi.co/ 

The App consist in get the data from the JSON Files and populating the fields 
through the models and integration data classes (DOA and DTO PAckages).

First Iniitializing on the #1 Pokemon ,BulbaSaur , and have field to search with the number of the pokemons.

The App is only funcional at the moment (and must be the 4th version that I created), for the future, I will
implement a better decoration and a list of pokemons group by generation and other Ideas that might come in 
my mind (or suggestion, of course).

Update 1.1

The Update bring a 2 new activities, the SplashScreen (a red display, still on working) and a list of pokemon available.
On the main screen, its possible to search the pokemon by its number if you already know, if not, at the end of the page
there is a button that led to the pokemon list, at the top click on the Magnifier and type the name of the pokemon, you will
note that the list update along with the name typing.
When you find the pokemon, click on it and the app will return to the main page with the detail of the pokemon chosen.

I am not a designer, my studies and aspiration led me to a technical carrer so the app can not be the cleaniest or prittier
but It has been a great experience. 

This Project (and the others on GIT) is a learning workplace, It might be not the best way or implementation
of the resources, but it`s my way of developing my skills in kotlyn (I used JAVA prior to that) and frameorks 
of the moment, I am open to Suggestion and feedback.

Someday the App will be on Play Store, I just dont have the re$ources to do it now, but the APK is on the following 
share. https://github.com/victor-rb/PokeDex/blob/master/Pokedex_v1.1.apk
